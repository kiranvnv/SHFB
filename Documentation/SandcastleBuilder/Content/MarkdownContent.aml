		<introduction>
			<para>The Markdown help format is used to produce content that can be viewed on websites that can transform
markdown files into HTML.  The presentation style supplied with the help file builder renders GitHub flavored
markdown content suitable for use on GitHub project wikis.  However, there are some known issues and limitations
as noted below.</para>

		</introduction>

		<section>
			<title>Knowns Issues and Limitations</title>
			<content>
						<para>If these limitations are not acceptable, it is suggested that you generate the content as a
true website and host it somewhere such as the GitHub Pages site related to your project rather than the wiki.</para>
					
				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>The markdown format works best for projects with a small number of conceptual topics and API
members.  Sites like GitHub render a sidebar which, for large projects, can become cumbersome to use when the
content is deeply nested.  You will have to be the judge as to whether or not the generated content is suitable
for use on a markdown website.</para>	
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>As noted, the markdown generated is geared towards GitHub flavored markdown.  Results may vary
on other sites.</para>

						<alert class="important">
							<para>The content generated is specifically for wiki sites.  It will not work properly if checked
into a source repository and viewed from the source code browser.</para>
						</alert>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Code colorization is left to the markdown processor provided it knows how to handle fenced code
blocks.  The line numbering and collapsible region features of the code block component are not supported.  Those
features will be ignored.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Obviously, the language filter from the HTML help formats is not supported.  As such,
language-specific text is shown using the generic, multi-language style.  Likewise, syntax sections and code
blocks are shown in a sequential fashion similar to the topic previewer.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Markdown processors make certain assumptions about the text based on the way it is formatted
which do not always hold true for the content generated by the presentation style.  In addition, certain HTML
elements must be formatted very specifically to work around issues in the markdown processors.  On GitHub for
example:</para>
					
						<list class="bullet">
							<listItem>
								<para>Table cells written in markdown cannot span multiple lines.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>List items written in markdown cannot contain multiple paragraphs.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Markdown elements embedded within certain HTML elements (i.e. HTML list items and table
cells elements) may not get processed in all cases.</para>
							</listItem>

							<listItem>
								<para>Various HTML block elements such as tables and lists must be preceded and followed by a
non-breaking space or the markdown processor may ignore markdown elements within the block elements.</para>
							</listItem>
						
						</list>

						<para>As such, a lot more HTML is generated by the presentation style than you would see if it was
written by hand to work around such limitations since the presentation style cannot assume the content fits the
layout requirements expected by the markdown processors.</para>

					</listItem>
					
					<listItem>
						<para>Address anchors on elements such as list items and table cells are not supported as GitHub
strips most attributes from elements.  Links to title elements and the introduction (page header) are
supported.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>"No Bullet" style lists and image placement options are not supported as GitHub strips the
style attribute from all elements.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Literal HTML in conceptual topics and XML comments may not be rendered as expected since the
markdown processor strips most attributes from the elements (<codeInline>id</codeInline>,
<codeInline>style</codeInline>, etc.).</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>It is not possible to check for and escape every possible markdown directive in conceptual
topic text and XML comments text.  As such, certain constructs may be interpreted as markdown and rendered
differently.  For example, if your comments contain the literal text <quoteInline>*Some text surrounded by
asterisks*</quoteInline>, it will most likely be rendered as emphasized text rather than literal text in
asterisks as it would in website output.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>GitHub uses the filename as the page title.  Topics will continue to use the selected naming
method and, as such, you will see that filename at the top of each page.  The topic title rendered by the
presentation style will appear below it.  This may not be ideal but is necessary.  The topic title cannot be used
as the filename since they need to be unique across all topics documented.  For example, if <codeInline>Class1</codeInline>
appeared in two separate namespaces and the topic titles were used as filenames, the topics from one of the
classes would overwrite the other.  Fully qualifying the names and including parameter information would allow
them to be unique but would most likely result in extremely long filenames that could exceed the maximum filename
length limit.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>GitHub expects there to be a <localUri>Home.md</localUri> topic within the site.  If one does
not appear, a copy of the default topic is made and named <localUri>Home.md</localUri> to satisfy this
requirement.  If your project contains a <localUri>Home.md</localUri> file included as content in the root of
your project or in a site map file, it will be copied to the build output and used instead.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Conceptual topics can be written in markdown, saved as <localUri>.md</localUri> files, and
included in the project.  However, they must be saved to the root folder of the project, their
<codeInline>Build Action</codeInline> property must be set to <codeInline>Content</codeInline>, and they must be
included in a site map file if you want them to appear in the table of contents (sidebar) generated by the
build.</para>
					</listItem>
					
					<listItem>
						<para>A page header is not supported and the page footer is a separate file in markdown content.  As
such, localized resource items cannot be used within the footer.  A default <localUri>_Footer.md</localUri> file
containing the help title, the additional footer information property content, the copyright URL, and contact
e-mail address is included by default.</para>

						<alert class="tip">
							<para>As in other help file formats, stock content file overrides are supported.  Including a
<localUri>Home.md</localUri> and/or <localUri>_Footer.md</localUri> file containing appropriate content in your
project's root folder with the Build Action set to <codeInline>Content</codeInline> will override the default
home page and/or footer in the generated content.</para>
						</alert>
					</listItem>
