			<title>Why is it called Sandcastle?</title>
			<content>
				<!-- Ignore Spelling: Anand Whidbey -->
				<para>From Anand Raman:  When Microsoft shipped Visual Studio 2005 (code named Whidbey) Microsoft
internally used a "beach theme" code base called Coronado to build and ship the conceptual and managed reference
content.  As a part of this beach theme, the managed reference reflection and build engine portion of the
Coronado code base was called Sandcastle.  Internally, Sandcastle was used by developers across teams to produce
documentation for their XML comments.</para>

				<para>Read through the topics in the <link xlink:href="b772e00e-1705-4062-adb6-774826ce6700" /> section
in the table of contents.  These will give you an overview of how to use Sandcastle, the help file builder, and
how to set up your projects to generate XML comments.</para>

			<title>I have been using version 1.7.0.0 or earlier.  The latest release is a significant change. Where did
option/feature X go?</title>
			<content>
				<para>Be sure to read through the version history starting at <link xlink:href="5a484e94-6940-4c97-940c-3f46fb8736d2" />
since it contains all of the information about the change in project format and the user interface.  The

that topic contains information about how to find features or equivalent functionality in the new release.</para>

			<title>How can I create a link to a conceptual topic/namespace element's help topic from an external source
such as application code or a page in an external website?</title>
			<content>
				<para>Set the project's <codeInline>NamingMethod</codeInline> property based on your preference and see
the <link xlink:href="1b2dff59-92cc-4578-b261-f3849f30c26c#NamingMethod">NamingMethod</link> help topic for
examples that show how to open specific topics based on the selected naming method from application code and how
to determine the URL for a website link.</para>

		<section address="BuildEvents">
			<title>Why don't my project's pre-build and/or post-build events evaluate and run correctly?</title>
			<content>
				<para>Pre-build and post-build events were not always supported in help file builder projects.  Older
projects created before they were supported do not contain the necessary properties and they will be incorrectly
added to the first property group if modified in the property pages.</para>

				<para>The pre-build and post-build event properties need to be added in a new property group at the very
end of the project after the help file builder target file import as shown in the following example:</para>

<code language="xml" title=" ">
&lt;Import Project="$(SHFBROOT)\SandcastleHelpFileBuilder.targets" /&gt;

&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
	&lt;PreBuildEvent&gt;ECHO "Hello from the pre-build event"&lt;/PreBuildEvent&gt;
	&lt;PostBuildEvent&gt;ECHO "Hello from the post-build event"&lt;/PostBuildEvent&gt;
	&lt;RunPostBuildEvent&gt;OnBuildSuccess&lt;/RunPostBuildEvent&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code>

				<para>This is necessary to allow the <codeInline>PreBuildEvent</codeInline> and
<codeInline>PostBuildEvent</codeInline> targets to be evaluated correctly.  They are imported from
<localUri>Microsoft.Common.Targets</localUri>.  You can edit the help file builder project in a text editor and
move the properties to the end of the file manually to correct the problem.</para>
